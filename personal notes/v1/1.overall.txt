Here’s a **clean, compact recap** — no fluff, no missing pieces — so you have a solid mental model of **Akshar**.

---

## 🪔 What *Akshar* Is

**Akshar** is a **desktop font-creation app** where users:

* Create fonts by **drawing each glyph**
* Work script-by-script (Latin, Devanagari, symbols, etc.)
* Save progress like a game
* Export finished fonts as installable `.ttf / .otf`

Think:

> *IbisPaint / Krita* + *Font editor*

---

## 🎯 What You’re Aiming to Build (v1)

### Core Capabilities

* Start screen → Home → Font editor → Glyph editor
* Grid-based workflow (fonts, glyphs)
* Draw glyphs on a canvas or import images
* Undo / redo
* Save and resume anytime
* Export fonts

### What v1 is **not**

* No kerning editor
* No ligatures
* No variable fonts
* No hinting

Those are v2+.

## 📁 File Structure (Practical, Minimal)

You’re using a **simple, AI-friendly structure**:

```
akshar/
│
├── main.py        # App entry
├── app.py         # Global state & navigation
├── ui.py          # All screens & dialogs
├── canvas.py      # Drawing tools & undo/redo
├── glyphs.py      # Unicode, glyph sets, metadata
├── storage.py     # Save/load .varn
├── export.py      # .ttf / .otf export
│
├── assets/        # Icons, themes
├── projects/      # .varn files
└── exports/       # Generated fonts
```

This keeps:

* Few files
* Large context
* Easy refactoring later

---

## 📦 `.varn` File (One Per Font)

Each font you create = **one `.varn` file**
It’s a **ZIP container** that stores everything needed to continue work.

```
MyFont.varn
│
├── manifest.json
├── font.json
├── glyphs/
│   ├── 0041.svg
│   ├── 0042.svg
│   └── ...
├── previews/
│   ├── font.png
│   └── glyphs/
│       └── ...
└── meta/
    └── app.json
```

* `glyphs/` = actual drawings
* `font.json` = Unicode + font data
* `meta/` = editor state
* `previews/` = UI thumbnails

Editable ≠ exported. Clean separation.

---

## 🖥️ UI Flow (Locked In)

```
App Launch
↓
Start Menu
↓
Home Screen (font grid)
↓
Font Editor (glyph grid)
↓
Glyph Editor (canvas)
```

Each screen has **one clear job**.

---

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions You Made Right

* Desktop-first (Python + Qt)
* `.varn` as a project/save file
* Unicode-based glyph identity
* Simple structure now, scalable later
* Avoided premature over-architecture

This is how real creative tools start.

---

## 🟢 Where You Are Now

You have:

* A clear product vision
* A locked project format
* A sane file structure
* A defined first UI

You’re **past the idea stage** — this is now an engineering project.

---

## 🔜 Natural Next Steps (Pick One Later)

* Design **Home Screen UI**
* Define **glyph grid behavior**
* Design **glyph canvas tools**
* Write **.varn save/load code**
* Build **MVP navigation**

Whenever you’re ready, say the word — we’ll build it step by step.
