wait wait, Sanketah is a app that will be used to create fonts. the gui will be very detailed. first the menu open that will have options to start, how to use, options. after pressing start a home page opens that will have the existing fonts we created in a grid format (like ibis paint where we can see the drawing directly at the home page). creating a new font - we will be given options for language/script - so there is latin, roman, devnagri, and accents. idk how it works u tell me how to categorize them. then all characters of that set will be visible in a grid format with a hamburger menu at the left. this menu will have undo, redo, save as .ttf, save as .owf, save progress (just saves progress to continue where we left off, create a save file just like a game). now if we exit or go back to home page after saving, the home page grid will have the thumbnail of the font that we are creating currently (let all letters be in a grid format on an a4 size paper and so this will be a thumbnail). this is the basic functionality. now each letter in the creating menu will have a button "Create Glyph" and then it will open a canvas where u can draw or import images like stickers/stamps. u get the basic idea? now simply suggest tech stack for this first
