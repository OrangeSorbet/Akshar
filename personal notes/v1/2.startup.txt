Perfect. We’ll design this **cleanly and intentionally**, not just “a screen”.

I’ll describe the **first-ever UI** of **Akshar** in terms of:

* Purpose
* Layout
* Components
* Behavior
* Why this design is correct

No code yet — just **solid UI/UX foundation**.

---

# 🪔 Akshar — First Launch UI (Start / Menu Screen)

This is the screen users see **when they open Akshar**.

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose of the First UI

This screen must answer **3 questions immediately**:

1. *What is Akshar?*
2. *What can I do here?*
3. *Where do I start?*

It should **not overwhelm** the user.

---

## 2️⃣ Screen Type

Call it:

> **Start Menu / Welcome Screen**

This is **not** the Home Screen yet.

---

## 3️⃣ Layout (Simple & Calm)

### Overall Layout: **Centered Vertical Stack**

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│                              │
│           AKSHAR              │
│       Font Creator            │
│                              │
│   [ Start ]                   │
│   [ How to Use ]              │
│   [ Settings ]                │
│                              │
│   Recent Project (optional)   │
│                              │
│   v0.1                        │
│                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

Dark or neutral background.
Minimal text.
Large, confident typography.

## 4️⃣ Components Breakdown

### 🔷 App Title

* **Text:** `AKSHAR`
* Subtitle: `Font Creator` or `Create Fonts by Drawing`
* Center-aligned
* This establishes identity instantly

---

### ▶️ Primary Button — **Start**

This is the most important button.

**Behavior:**

* If **no projects exist** → goes to *New Font Setup*
* If projects exist → goes to *Home Screen (font grid)*

This avoids asking questions too early.

---

### 📘 Secondary Button — **How to Use**

* Opens a **non-blocking overlay**
* Explains:

  * What a font is
  * What a glyph is
  * Basic workflow
* Can be skipped anytime

This should **never block usage**.

---

### ⚙️ Tertiary Button — **Settings**

* Small
* Bottom-aligned or icon-based
* Things like:

  * Theme
  * Default export path
  * Autosave

---

### 🕘 Optional: Recent Project Shortcut

Only shown if:

* A `.varn` file exists

Example:

```
Continue: MyFont.varn
```

This feels *game-like* and friendly.

---

### 🧾 Footer

* Version number
* Small and subtle

---

## 5️⃣ What This Screen Does NOT Do (Important)

❌ No font grid
❌ No glyphs
❌ No canvas
❌ No file browsing

This screen is **about intent**, not work.

---

## 6️⃣ Navigation Logic (Very Important)

```
App Launch
   ↓
Start Menu
   ↓
(Start)
   ↓
Home Screen (Font Grid)
   ↓
Font Editor
```

The user is never confused about:

* Where they are
* What to do next

---

## 7️⃣ Why This Is the Correct First UI

✔ Familiar (feels like a game / creative tool)
✔ Calm (not intimidating)
✔ Brand-focused
✔ Scales well later
✔ Easy to implement

Professional tools (Blender, Krita, Unity) follow this pattern for a reason.

---

## 8️⃣ Minimal Qt Implementation Concept (Mental Model)

* One `MainWindow`
* This screen = one central widget
* Later screens replace it

No window spawning madness.

---

## 9️⃣ Naming (Lock This In)

Let’s lock the screen names early:

| Screen       | Name          |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| First screen | `StartMenu`   |
| Font grid    | `HomeScreen`  |
| Glyph grid   | `FontEditor`  |
| Drawing      | `GlyphEditor` |

Names matter later.

---

## Next Step (Logical Progression)

Next, we should design **Home Screen (Font Grid)** because:

* It defines how `.varn` files live in the app
* It drives most navigation

👉 Say: **“Home screen”** and we’ll design it just as cleanly.
